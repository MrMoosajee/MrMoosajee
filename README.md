# Hi, I’m Shuaib Adams (@MrMoosajee) 🇿🇦
### **AI Systems Architect | Creator of "The Foundry" | Specialist in Agentic Governance**

I am a Systems Architect focused on solving the **"Logic Drift"** problem in Autonomous AI Workflows. While the industry focuses on simple prompt chaining, I architect **"Bicameral" AI systems** that separate **Governance** (Strategy) from **Execution** (Labor).

### 🚀 **Current Build: The Foundry v3.1**
I am currently the CTO of *The Foundry*, a self-hosted autonomous engineering corporation designed to operate with zero drift.
* **Governance Layer:** Architected a **"Pentad Council"** (5-model consensus using Gemini 3.0 & DeepSeek) that validates every strategic move via **Machine Readable Specs (MRS)**.
* **Zero-Drift Protocol:** Implemented a **Global State Key** (Redis) check before every execution step, ensuring the swarm freezes instantly if it deviates from the spec.
* **Hybrid-Compute Strategy:** Orchestrating a cost-efficient split between local privacy models (Phi-4, Qwen) and cloud reasoning (Gemini 1.5 Pro) via **n8n** and **MCP**.

### 🛠️ **Engineering Philosophy: The "High-Output" Mindset**
Building in the South African tech landscape (with constraints like load shedding and distance learning) has taught me to engineer for extreme efficiency. I do not rely on infinite bandwidth or budget. I build **10x Systems**—using "Hybrid-Local" architectures to bypass connectivity bottlenecks and cost barriers.

### 💻 **Tech Stack & Arsenal**
* **Orchestration:** n8n (Advanced Workflow Logic), Model Context Protocol (MCP)
* **Governance:** Redis (State Management), PostgreSQL (ACID Compliance)
* **Languages:** Python (Custom Tooling), SQL (Schema Design), Bash/Linux
* **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose, Tailscale (Zero-Trust Mesh), Pop!_OS (Linux Host)
